# CircleTag
This is another game I designed in high school for my friends and I to play. It is a multiplayer game of tag with a pacman-like theme. The red player tries to catch any of the blue players, but if you are the red player you move through the portals on each side of the map more slowly.

PLEASE NOTE: This was made in high school and before I realized code style and documentation were important. It's still a fun game though :).
