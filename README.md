# CircleTag: Made in high school
PLEASE NOTE: This was made in high school and before I realized code style and documentation were important. It's still a fun game though :).

This is another game I designed for my friends and I to play. It is a multiplayer game of tag with a pacman-like theme. The red player tries to catch any of the blue players, but if you are the red player you move through the portals on each side of the map more slowly.

Steps to run:
1. If you are the host, input a port under select port and click start game.
2. Once a game is started, input the host's IP in the Game IP spot and the game's port in the Game's Port spot. Then click Join Game.
3. Enter a name for your character
4. Now you are in the game. Use WASD to move in the respective directions.
